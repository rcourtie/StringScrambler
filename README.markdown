# StringScrambler

StringScrambler is a stupid little utility that I wrote to generate
scrambled versions of my name to use as usernames for websites. I like javascript so I wrote it in javascript.

## Example usage

```javascript
var s = StringScrambler("Connington");
var scrambledString = s.scramble(); // returns a scrambled string
```
